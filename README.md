javascript jeopardy
===================
I've updated javascript jeopardy to use newer Bootstrap and jQuery versions.  
Also moved board.json to script.js to avoid cross-origin issues.

Original git repository: https://github.com/mc706/javascript-jeopardy.git  

Original Description
===================
Javascript Jeopardy is a single page, self contained, jeopardy board rendered using Twitter Bootstrap and Jquery.

The categories, questions, answers, and scoring all driven by the board.json file.

builder.html is a page build in Twitter Bootstrap and Angular.JS for creating and editing the board.json file.
